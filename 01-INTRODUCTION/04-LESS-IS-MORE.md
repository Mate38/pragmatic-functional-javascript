# Less is more

In this book, we will deprecate a lot of things from JS that you probably uses.
Imperative programming introduces several statements to solve the same sort of
problems, but why is this a problem? Having different ways to solve a problem
in a same context and without a very specific reason to tell one from another
introduces **complexity**. It is a lot easier to understand how one thing works
and build things around that than learning how dozens of things work and why
they are being used in a context (most times arbitrarily).

Start forgetting almost all you know about JavaScript statements. This will
discussed in depth in another section of the book, I promise!

We'll focus on a problem and the most simple and pragmatic solution for it. If
the solution can be reused for other problems, then we have an advantage, and
this is true for most problems.

In order to **learn** some functional good practices, you'll have to **unlearn**
some empiric bad practices.
