# WHAT DOES "PRAGMATISM" MEAN?

Pragmatism, noun, a **practical** aproach to problems and affairs. There is no
word that can describe this book better. We are going to focus on practical
applications of the beautiful and enchanting theory built around functional
programming. This book is made for people with basic knowledges on JavaScript
programming; you definitely shouldn't have exceptional abilities to understand
the things here written: it is made to be practical, simple, concise and after
that we except you to be able to write real world applications using the
functional paradigm and finally say "I **do** work with functional
programming!".
